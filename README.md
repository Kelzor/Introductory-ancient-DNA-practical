# Introductory ancient DNA (aDNA) practical
Ancient DNA and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) practical designed for archaeology students (at the undergraduate and graduate level) with no prior experience with genomics or bioinformatics. 

This exercise uses publicly available data published by Pfrengle et al., 2021 https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-021-01120-2

This exercise requires no coding or coding experience, as all relevant files have been generated for you.


## [aDNA Data Analysis I: recovering mitochondrial genomes from NGS shotgun data](https://github.com/Kelzor/Introductory-ancient-DNA-practical/blob/main/aDNA%20Data%20Analysis%20I/aDNA_Data_Analysis_I.md)

__Learning objectives__: in this lesson you will determine if shotgun sequencing data contain sufficient reads to assign human mitochrondrial haplogroups. 

You will gaine familiarity with the following:

+ Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) file formats
  - FASTQ: Contains raw sequence reads and quality scores.
  - SAM/BAM: Binary alignment formats for storing mapped reads.
  - VCF: Variant Call Format for storing genetic variation data.
+ Quality control metrics used to assess aDNA quantity and quality and the tools used to generate them
  - fastqc
  - qualimap
  - MapDamage
  - PMDtools
+ Necessary considerations when identifying variants in low-coverage, damaged DNA sequencing reads

## aDNA Data Analysis II: assessment and evolutionary analysis of ancient _Mycobacterium leprae_ genomes

__Learning objectives__: in this lesson you will reinforce what you learned in Part I by assessing the quality of reads mapped to the _M. leprae_ reference genome. Additionally, you will learn how to make phylogenetic trees and draw evolutionary inferences from them.

You will 

+ Review all content from Analysis Part I
+ Make phylogenetic trees
  - MEGAX
+ Interpret phylogenetic trees


## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section num. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.
